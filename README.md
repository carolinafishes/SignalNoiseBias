Description:

Analysis of the Prum et al 2015 loci can be found in:
	Birds/   
Within this directory are the siterates, model parameters, and mathematica notebooks	
	Birds/MathematicaInputs
To run analyses across loci, note that the RunEverything notebook is used with the template to loop over all individual locus rate vectors and model parameters
	
Analysis of the Alfaro et al 2018 loci can be found in:
	Percomorpha/   
Within this directory are the siterates, model parameters, and mathematica notebooks	
	Percomorpha/MathematicaInputs
To run analyses across loci, note that the RunEverything notebook is used with the template to loop over all individual locus rate vectors and model parameters

Utility scripts for formatting and summarizing mathematica outputs can be found in:
